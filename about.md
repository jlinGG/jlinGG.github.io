<h1>Hello World!</h1>
Welcome to my blog, where I write about the data things that I am doing and learning.  This is really just a reference for Future Joanne, but I'm happy you are here too.

### Why giraffes?

The development process is kind of like evolution, no?  You make code edits little by little, version by version, until you have a fully-formed giraffe.  It may be awkward to look at, but it is standing and functional.  Maybe even beautiful.  

<H2>About Me</H2>
I am a data scientist, currently based Washington, DC. I graduated from Thinkful's Data Science program in June 2018.  I love  utilizing data to find the truth, create solutions, and tell data-driven stories. I have an "untraditional" data science background, graduating from UC Berkeley with BAs in Public Health and Sociology, and later getting my Masters in Public Health.  In my free time, I enjoy knitting funky shawls and attempting minimalist nail art.
